# Job Website
- A job portal for both job seekers and recruiters.
- Job seekers can browse and apply for job openings, submitting their resumes, while recruiters can post and manage job listings, assess incoming resumes, and send interview invitations.
- The front-end **Single Page Application** is constructed using reactive framework **Vue**, leveraging **Vue Router** for component navigation, **Pinia** for state management across components, and **Vite** as both a dev server and a build tool.
- The back-end **RESTful API** is developed with **Node.js** framework **Fastify**, utilizing **JSON Web Token** for authentication, and **JSON schema** for validation, and **Drizzle ORM** to interact with relational database **PostgreSQL**.
